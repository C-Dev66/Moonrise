## <center>Hello, I'm Carlos on the web I go by CDev66 ðŸ‘‹</center>

---

Iâ€™m a test engineer and lifelong learner with a passion for High Performace Driving (HPD), Rocketry, and hands on projects. By day, I work in the automotive electrical powertrain field, and by night, I enjoy exploring personal projects that push my curiosity further.

Currently, Iâ€™m diving into the world of Rocketry, working toward my High Power Rocket (HPR) Level 1 certification and learning how sustainable energy and propulsion systems can shape the future. I enjoy blending my background in engineering with my love for building, tinkering, and discovering new ways to solve complex problems.

This site is my place to share notes, projects, and ideas as I continue my journey in engineering and beyond.
